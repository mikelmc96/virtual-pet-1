# virtual-pet
In this game your goal is to keep your pet elephant alive.  This elephant's name is Panchu. :elephant: 
He loves to **play**:paw_prints:, but this can make him tired, hungry, and dirty.  
Make sure that he gets enough **food**:herb: and **sleep** :sleepy:, and make sure that he takes a **bath**:shower: every now and then.  
You can **check** to see how he's doing--just remember that each time you interact with him, he gets a little bored, tired, hungry, and dirty.

He's just woken up, taken a bath, and had breakfast.  
**Why don't you take him out to play?**
